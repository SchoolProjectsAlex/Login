The NEST was constructed in 1991 following the discovery of the G-Virus within a human test subject. Either due to the small size or aging nature of the Arklay Laboratory, Umbrella CEO Dr. Oswell E. Spencer felt an entirely new facility was necessary for this research.[1][2] Dr. William Birkin, the Arklay Laboratory's chief researcher, was transferred to the laboratory personally to carry out the research along with his wife, Annette.[1]

<b>Raccoon City Destruction Incident</b><br />
In mid-1998, the Birkins began contaminating Umbrella facilities across the city as part of a plan to hand over themselves and the G-Virus to the U.S. military as a critical element in their bioweapons program. Aware of an attempt by the Umbrella Security Service to steal it, they released their own Hunter R test-subjects from containment and allowed the t-Virus to spread across the facility in order to distract or destroy the unit. At least two USS soldiers were able to reach the P-12A lab in late September and steal G-Virus samples; the subsequent battle with a G-mutated William led to the t-Virus spreading into Raccoon City's drinking water.[3]

Following the sabotage and raid, there was no one left to control the facility and the researchers were forced to deal with the escaped Hunter Rs on their own with no security team. By rigging the low-temperature laboratory to affect the entirety of level B4F, Dr. Frost was able to force the Hunters to undergo brumation, freezing them in their tracks. Nonetheless, at least ten researchers were killed in the attack.[4]
